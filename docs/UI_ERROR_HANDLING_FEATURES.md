# UI Error Handling Features

## 🎨 **Enhanced Event Timeline**

The UI has been significantly enhanced to provide complete visibility into the SDL try/catch error handling system. Here's what you'll see when your try/catch workflow executes:

## ✅ **New UI Features**

### 1. **Retry Attempt Tracking**
- **Current Attempt Counter**: Shows "Attempt 3 / 5" when retrying
- **Retry Policy Display**: Shows "Max: 5 (exponential)" for policy info
- **Visual Progress**: Clear indication of retry progress

### 2. **Task Status Visualization**
- **Success Badge**: Green badge with checkmark for successful tasks
- **Failure Badge**: Red badge with X for failed tasks
- **Running Badge**: Yellow badge for tasks in progress

### 3. **Error Message Display**
- **Error Details**: Full error messages in red error boxes
- **Error Context**: Complete error information with proper formatting
- **Task Failure Indication**: Clear visual indication when tasks fail

### 4. **Try Task Recognition**
- **Shield Icon**: Special shield icon for try tasks
- **Retry Policy Info**: Shows max attempts and backoff strategy
- **Error Recovery**: Visual indication of error handling

### 5. **Enhanced Timeline Icons**
- **Green Circle**: Successful task completion
- **Red Circle**: Failed task completion
- **Yellow Circle**: Task currently running

## 🎯 **Visual Examples**

### Successful Try Task with Retries
```
🛡️ Task: callExternalAPI            [✅ Success] [🔄 Attempt 3 / 5] [Max: 5 (exponential)]
   ⏰ Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:15
   ✅ Completed: 2024-01-15 10:30:18
```

### Failed Try Task After Retries Exhausted
```
🛡️ Task: processPayment             [❌ Failed] [🔄 Attempt 5 / 5] [Max: 5 (linear)]
   ⏰ Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:20
   ❌ Failed: 2024-01-15 10:30:35
   
   ⚠️ Task Failed
   API call failed with status 503: Service Unavailable
```

### Try Task with Recovery
```
🛡️ Task: paymentWithRecovery        [❌ Failed] [🔄 Attempt 3 / 3] [Max: 3 (constant)]
   ⏰ Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:40
   ❌ Failed: 2024-01-15 10:30:50
   
   ⚠️ Task Failed
   Payment failed with status 402: Payment Required
   
📧 Task: notifyCustomer             [✅ Success]
   ⏰ Started: 2024-01-15 10:30:51
   ✅ Completed: 2024-01-15 10:30:52
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Enhanced Event Timeline Component
The `EventTimeline` component now includes:

1. **Retry Attempt Detection**
   ```typescript
   const retryAttempts = getTaskRetryAttempts(taskName, events)
   const currentAttempt = retryAttempts.length
   ```

2. **Error Information Extraction**
   ```typescript
   const completionInfo = getTaskCompletionInfo(completedEvent)
   const { success, error } = completionInfo
   ```

3. **Retry Policy Display**
   ```typescript
   const retryPolicy = extractRetryPolicy(requestedEvent)
   // Shows: Max: 5 (exponential)
   ```

### New Helper Functions
- `getTaskRetryAttempts()`: Tracks all retry attempts for a task
- `getTaskCompletionInfo()`: Extracts success status and error messages
- `extractRetryPolicy()`: Gets retry configuration from try tasks

## 📊 **Event Data Structure**

### Task Completion Event (Success)
```json
{
  "type": "io.flunq.task.completed",
  "data": {
    "task_name": "callAPI",
    "success": true,
    "output": { "result": "API call successful" },
    "duration_ms": 2000
  }
}
```

### Task Completion Event (Failed)
```json
{
  "type": "io.flunq.task.completed",
  "data": {
    "task_name": "callAPI",
    "success": false,
    "error": "API call failed with status 503: Service Unavailable",
    "output": {},
    "duration_ms": 5000
  }
}
```

### Try Task Request Event
```json
{
  "type": "io.flunq.task.requested",
  "data": {
    "task_name": "apiCallWithRetry",
    "task_type": "try",
    "config": {
      "parameters": {
        "catch": {
          "retry": {
            "limit": { "attempt": { "count": 5 } },
            "backoff": { "exponential": { "multiplier": 2.0 } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### Before (Old UI)
- ❌ All task completions shown as "Success"
- ❌ No retry attempt visibility
- ❌ No error message display
- ❌ No distinction between success/failure

### After (Enhanced UI)
- ✅ Clear success/failure indication
- ✅ Retry attempt counter with progress
- ✅ Full error messages displayed
- ✅ Retry policy information shown
- ✅ Special try task recognition
- ✅ Color-coded timeline icons

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what's happening during retries
2. **Error Debugging**: Full error messages help with troubleshooting
3. **Progress Tracking**: Know how many attempts have been made
4. **Policy Awareness**: Understand the retry configuration
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded status makes it easy to scan

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Potential future UI improvements:
- Real-time retry progress indicators
- Retry timing charts and graphs
- Error pattern analysis
- Retry policy recommendations
- Interactive retry controls

The enhanced UI provides **complete visibility** into the SDL error handling system, making it easy to monitor, debug, and understand workflow error handling behavior! 🎉
